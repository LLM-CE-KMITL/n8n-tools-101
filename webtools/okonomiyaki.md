# Quick Okonomiyaki Recipe
This is a versatile dish, so feel free to adjust ingredients based on what you have!

## 1. Make the Batter
* In a bowl, whisk together 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup dashi (or water), and 1 egg until smooth.

* Stir in about 2-3 cups shredded cabbage. For traditional okonomiyaki, you can also add tempura scraps (tenkasu) and finely chopped pickled red ginger (beni shoga).

## 2. Prepare Fillings & Cook

* Heat a lightly oiled griddle or large non-stick pan over medium heat.

* Pour about 1/2 of the batter mixture onto the griddle to form a round pancake.

* Add your desired fillings on top: thin slices of pork belly are common, but you can use shrimp, squid, or other meats/vegetables.

* Cook for about 5-7 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Press down gently while cooking.

* Repeat for the second pancake.

## 3. Garnish & Serve

* Transfer the cooked okonomiyaki to a plate.

* Drizzle generously with Okonomiyaki sauce and Japanese mayonnaise.

* Sprinkle with katsuobushi (bonito flakes) and aonori (dried seaweed flakes).

* Serve hot!
