# Playing Tic-Tac-Toe is simple! Here's a quick guide:

## The Goal:

* Be the first to get three of your marks (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
How to Play:

## The Grid: Draw a 3x3 grid (like a hashtag: #).

1. Players & Marks: Two players take turns. One player is "X", the other is "O".
2. Taking Turns: Player X goes first, placing an "X" in any empty square. Then Player O places an "O" in any other empty square.
3. Winning: The game ends when one player gets three of their marks in a straight line.
4. Draw: If all 9 squares are filled and no one has three in a row, it's a draw (or "cat's game").
